<p>Did you just hear about the PayPal Money Adder and you can’t tell whether or not if it&#8217;s a scam​ or a real free money generator?</p>



<p>PayPal Money Adder seems like a cool, free way to add some easy cash to your PayPal account, but does it really perform the way it says it does or it&#8217;s a total nonsense?</p>



<p>There are similar tools like PayPal Money Adder out there like NewPaypalHack in this review I am going to go over all the aspects so that you know the truth!</p>



<h4>What is Money PayPal Adder ?</h4>



<p>Paypal Money Adder also known as Paypal Money Generator is a tool that supposedly can make you easy free money that you can add to your Paypal account.</p>



<p>The tool says that it&#8217;s going to hijack PayPal, and that they have done all the hard work for us .</p>



<p>Basically all you’d have to do is enter the email address where you’d like to receive the money on or you can choose to download a free software on your android smartphone &nbsp;or even on your computer .</p>



<p>But there’s a bit of a catch, to receive your money you must complete a survey offer, there are several surveys you can choose from.</p>



<p>After completing the survey, the requested free PayPal money will be sent to your PayPal. As said by PayPal Money Adder.</p>



<h4>Does it actually work or is it just another scam? </h4>



<h4>Does PayPal Money Adder work?<br></h4>



<p>Sadly, Paypal Money Adder does not work, it&#8217;s just another scam, they are not going to send you any money. <br></p>



<p>If you’re using this tool you&#8217;re also putting yourself in a big risk because your identity is at risk with this tool!<br></p>



<p>This is how Paypal Money Adder works according to them:<br></p>



<ul><li>Enter your PayPal email address</li><li>download a software on your computer </li><li>Or you can use your Android phone by installing the Paypal Money Adder app</li><li>Complete the human verification process</li><li>enter the amount of money you want to generate</li><li>complete some paid surveys</li><li>Click the generate button to send money to your Paypal</li></ul>



<p>The tool wants you to add your Paypal email address and install a suspicious software on your site, that can actually be very risky and can cause more damage than anticipated.<br></p>



<p>Free PaypalMoney? There is No Such Thing as That!<br></p>



<p>You should always remember if something is too good to be true, it is, and if someone is giving you something for free there has to be a catch.<br></p>



<p>That&#8217;s the case with Free Paypal Money Adder, Paypal Money Generator or any tool that guarantees free money!<br></p>



<p>I will be explaining why this is a scam and how they are going to make money off you by lying and manipulating &nbsp;you into thinking you can actually earn free money.<br></p>



<h4>Can You Earn with PayPal Money Adder?</h4>



<p>I promise you Paypal Money Adder is not going to make you any type of money, when you give them your email address or download those dangerous softwares you’ll be putting a lot of things factors in risk. <br></p>



<p>The developers of Paypal Money Adder are the only ones that are going to make money and by using people who use their tool. <br></p>



<p>The idea of this tool is to trick you into thinking you can earn free money when in reality they just need you to complete their surveys.<br></p>



<p>Paypal Money Adder wants you to:<br></p>



<ul><li>Download the free Software on your PC</li><li>Take Surveys, Play games or complete offers (this is the way Paypal Money Adder makes their own money!)</li></ul>



<p>Once you download the program to your computer which is very dangerous and deceiving you’ll regret it instantly because it will damage your computer by spreading multiple viruses.<br></p>



<p>Or even worse it might hijack your personal information or use your identity to do illegal stuff online which might result in loads of trouble with serious people.<br></p>



<p>In regards to the surveys, Paypal Money Adder wants you to complete some offers, they may even get you to play some games or complete offers that ask for your bank account information.<br></p>



<p>PayPal Money Adder is a Scam..<br></p>



<p>I hope this review has not only help you understand what Paypal Money Adder is actually is but recognize any similar scams. This program turned out to be a total scam that is only going to harm you.<br></p>



<p>This program is in fact illegal, using it might get you in lots of trouble.<br></p>



<p>Do not never download unknown software on your computer because this is going to only harm &nbsp;it and get a hold of your identity or any other personal qualities.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hey guys , It&#8217;s Clarissa again and today i&#8217;ll be examining the legitimacy of another program . </p>



<p>Lately I have been hearing of this new program, “<strong>Internet Funnel Profits</strong>”. The program seems to promise its users a more than substantial income with little to no work. I&#8217;ve been keeping a close eye on this program, and I will tell you all that you need to know about it. Continue reading for my entire review on this program. </p>



<h4><em>What is Internet Funnel Profits ?</em> </h4>



<p><strong>Internet Funnel Profits</strong> is a program that pledges its users an $10,000 commission rate for every ticket sold. You are also promised $500 if you watch the entire video from start to finish. That is a complete lie, you will not receive that $500. <strong>Internet Funnel Profits</strong>,<strong> </strong>is merely a sales funnel to the Ultimate Dot Com also known as UDC System which in return will sell you another program called <strong>MOBE</strong>.<br></p>



<h4>Do I recommend Internet Funnel Profits?</h4>



<p>Absolutely not, the program does not live up to it’s guarantees and lies to its users. You’ll end up losing up to $60,000. <br></p>



<h4><em>2019 Update ! This Scam Changed Their Name!</em></h4>



<p><strong>Internet Funnel Profits</strong> happens to promote a very expensive product called <strong>MOBE</strong>. In fact, the program has actually been shut down by the FTC (<strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong>) .</p>



<p>Due to being shut down, Internet Funnel Profits has to find a way to recreate their brand and continue scamming its users. </p>



<p>The new program now goes by <strong>MyFunnelProfits</strong> and can also be found at <strong>myfunnelprofits.com. </strong></p>



<p>Once you enter your email you will be brought to another program by the name of <strong>The Secret Affiliate Machine</strong>. Needless to say, both programs are still SCAMS that will eventually cost you thousands more than you ever anticipated. <br></p>



<h4><em>How does Internet Funnel Profits work?</em></h4>



<p>Internet Funnel Profits happens to be one of the dozen programs that are a part of an entire network of scams. They all go by different names but offer the same opportunity from the two; <strong>Ultimate Dot Com Lifestyle</strong> or <strong>MOBE</strong>.<br></p>



<h4>But what is MOBE?</h4>



<p><strong>MOBE</strong> is a training program where you will be instructed by a mentor how to authorize <strong>MOBE</strong> products and earn a profit from selling them. <br></p>



<h4><em>How Much Will Internet Funnel Profits Cost</em>?</h4>



<p>Since Internet Funnel Profits is a high ticket opportunity and directs you to <strong>MOBE. </strong></p>



<p>In all you should expect to spend about $60,000</p>



<p>As I mentioned previously, I do not recommend you take part in this program, especially a program you have no knowledge of. Beware of this program. </p>



<p><strong>Internet Funnel Profits</strong> will only lie and take your money, <strong>MOBE</strong> on the other hand can possibly earn you cash if you follow the training precisely.<br></p>



<h4><em>Is Internet Funnel Profits A Scam?</em></h4>



<p>Once more, Internet Funnel Profits is a scam. I do not recommend you take part in this. </p>



<p>Every guarantee that you may have been told are lies and you’ll be preparing yourself to get robbed of thousands of dollars. On the bright side, there are genuine opportunities out there that can actually make you money that are free. <br></p>

<p>It&#8217;s Clarissa and I will be reviewing the network Profit Genesis Reloaded 2.0. I&#8217;ll be informing you guys whether it is <a href="http://scamverify.co/legit">real</a> and worth the time or a phony like most of these networks are. </p>



<h4>What is it?</h4>



<p>To begin with, Profit Genesis Reloaded 2.0 is a training program that like others promise to make you rich at home . Profit Genesis Reloaded 2.0 program is a step by step instructions manual that you have to follow to set up your weekly payments of up to $5,000. But it doesn&#8217;t really tell you what exactly you are doing which usually the first warning strike for me and you should proceed with caution from here on . </p>



<h4>How does it allegedly work ?</h4>



<p>Profit Genesis is the same as all the other hyped up networks that promise you a service. In return you get thousands within seconds . They sell their scam off by trying to pull people in with a believed &#8220;secret&#8221; or loophole that can help you make thousands online in a few seconds.</p>



<h4>What actually happens?</h4>



<p>Profit Genesis charges you an entrance fee of $37. Which would seem worth it in return for thousands of dollars weekly right ? What they want from you is to be able to willingly invest in yourself with a fee as small as $37 but in actuality they just take your money and provide you with useless PDFs on setting up shops on eCommerce. </p>



<h4>A Few Red Flags On Profit Genesis </h4>



<ul><li>The Owner is fake</li><li>The Testimonials are fake </li><li>The Program is basically a reboot</li></ul>



<h4>The Owner Of Profit Genesis</h4>



<p>The owner is said to be named David Miller but that is just an alias . In the program they provide a photo of Mr.Miller scuba diving . But that photo is a stolen stock photo online from stock photography. Basically the real owner is hiding because they do not want to be <a href="http://cloutpay.co">backtracked</a> which is shady.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://fulltimehomebusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/profitgenesisreloadedscamorlegit.png" alt="profit genesis reloaded 2.0 the owner is fake using fake scuba diving stock imagery"/></figure></div>



<h4>Testimonials</h4>



<p>Once you do your research , you will find out that the testimonials are actually paid actors who will fake it out for you as long as you write the script . It is safe to say that this is a site you should stay as far away from as possible. Everything about this seems wrong and off . The in-authenticity of it just irks me .  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-333" srcset="https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5.png 728w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5-300x122.png 300w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5-50x20.png 50w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5-370x150.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></figure>



<h4>Reboot</h4>



<p>What I mean when I say this is that this program has been done already but just with a different name. The owner is back for more blood in a sense as if they weren&#8217;t satisfied with the amount of people they scammed before . If you&#8217;re reading this make sure you was stay clear of scams like this. Do your research before jumping into anything it&#8217;s very important . You don&#8217;t want to lose money thinking you&#8217;re going to make it.</p>



<h2>Profit Genesis Conclusion </h2>



<p>In conclusion , If you came this far you pretty much know that this is a big SCAM. I want to inform you guys to stay clear because I do have your best interest at hand and this will only lose you money which no one likes to do . </p>

<p>Hey guys, it’s Clarissa. This time around I’ll be reviewing, “Clout Pay”. Several of you insist that I investigate the website’s <a href="http://scamverify.co/category/legit/">credibility</a> and overall usefulness. So that is exactly what I’ll be doing, read ahead for some rather important info on Clout Pay.<br></p>



<h2><strong>What&#8217;s Clout Pay? </strong></h2>



<p>As crazy as it may sound, Clout Pay is actually an Influencer Network. The website has been around since 2015 and has achieved quite some popularity over the years. The site has even gained an estimated amount of 300,000+ users/members. <br></p>



<h3>Run Through of Clout Pay</h3>



<h4><em>First Outlook</em></h4>



<p>While reviewing the website, I happened to notice the simplicity in its format. What I mean is, the website didn&#8217;t bombard me with any unwanted information. If anything the website kept the most relevant details terse but instructive. This actually came to me as a good sign, I say this because the websites that tend to scam usually give out loads of information to in return give off the feeling of legitimacy. <br></p>



<h4><em>What do you do?</em></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1-1024x405.png" alt="Clout Pay steps" class="wp-image-11" srcset="https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1-1024x405.png 1024w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1-300x119.png 300w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1-768x304.png 768w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1-50x20.png 50w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-1.png 1090w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I’d like to start off by saying the following information is not a joke, there’s no invisible text or anything that may mislead you. There are only two things you do to start earning cash which is, signing up and sharing your referral link. The website gives you an individual referral link that you then share across any of your social media platforms. To gain your referral link you must first sign up with Clout Pay and immediately you shall receive your link. Soon after you’re ready to start earning some easy money.<br></p>



<h4><em>Sign Up</em></h4>



<p>The <a href="https://cloutpay.co">sign-up</a> process is relatively easy. After filling out the basic information required you’re quickly prompted to the dashboard. As silly as it may sound the dashboard section was quite exhilarating. Within the dashboard presented the most important factor in your money-making process, the referral link. <br></p>



<h4><em>Sharing</em></h4>



<p>The most dependent variable in your money making quest is sharing. I was a bit hesitant on sharing my link only because I didn&#8217;t want to lead anyone on with any false information. But despite my second-guessing, I shared the link to all my family and friends on different outlets. A little after a week of sharing I started to see something happen, I was making actual money. <br></p>



<h3>How does Clout Pay work?</h3>



<p>Although, after reading some convincing words I know there’s still some skepticism about how Clout Pay actually works. But here’s the breakdown, when you begin to invite your family and friends you actually contribute to generating traffic to the website and broaden ad revenue. Another outcome of sharing the website is welcoming an awareness to any sponsored products which will start an increase in sponsor relations.<br></p>



<h4><em>Getting Paid</em></h4>



<p>Here’s the most important information you’ve been waiting for, getting paid. The payout process is fast and easy. When you’re ready to receive your profit you simply request your payment. &nbsp;Payments are sent immediately after you’ve scheduled. There are various methods to receive your money which ranges from PayPal, Cash App, Bitcoin, and even mailed checks if preferred. During the time I decided to payout I took note of how long it took me to receive my pay. I can say Clout Pay has an excellent payout speed because right after paying out I got my notification that my payment had been deposited to my account. <br><br></p>



<h4><em>Clout Pay Testimonials</em></h4>



<p>Typically, I never see reviews post their transactions. But after reviewing I was surprised to see that people were actually receiving real-time payments from Clout Pay. This encouraged me to start earning my own cash and get paid. I’m proud to say that thanks to Clout Pay, I have made almost 6000 dollars over the course of one week. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p><br>After some first-hand investigation, I can say the Clout Pay is as legit as they come. I can admit I was a bit nervous going into this in fear that I may get scammed but it was the total opposite. Seeing how easy it is to make money I don’t think I’ll ever stop. If anything I’ll make it a side job. I strongly advise you guys to try out Clout Pay and start earning.
