<p>It&#8217;s Clarissa and I will be reviewing the network Profit Genesis Reloaded 2.0. I&#8217;ll be informing you guys whether it is <a href="http://scamverify.co/legit">real</a> and worth the time or a phony like most of these networks are. </p>



<h4>What is it?</h4>



<p>To begin with, Profit Genesis Reloaded 2.0 is a training program that like others promise to make you rich at home . Profit Genesis Reloaded 2.0 program is a step by step instructions manual that you have to follow to set up your weekly payments of up to $5,000. But it doesn&#8217;t really tell you what exactly you are doing which usually the first warning strike for me and you should proceed with caution from here on . </p>



<h4>How does it allegedly work ?</h4>



<p>Profit Genesis is the same as all the other hyped up networks that promise you a service. In return you get thousands within seconds . They sell their scam off by trying to pull people in with a believed &#8220;secret&#8221; or loophole that can help you make thousands online in a few seconds.</p>



<h4>What actually happens?</h4>



<p>Profit Genesis charges you an entrance fee of $37. Which would seem worth it in return for thousands of dollars weekly right ? What they want from you is to be able to willingly invest in yourself with a fee as small as $37 but in actuality they just take your money and provide you with useless PDFs on setting up shops on eCommerce. </p>



<h4>A Few Red Flags On Profit Genesis </h4>



<ul><li>The Owner is fake</li><li>The Testimonials are fake </li><li>The Program is basically a reboot</li></ul>



<h4>The Owner Of Profit Genesis</h4>



<p>The owner is said to be named David Miller but that is just an alias . In the program they provide a photo of Mr.Miller scuba diving . But that photo is a stolen stock photo online from stock photography. Basically the real owner is hiding because they do not want to be <a href="http://cloutpay.co">backtracked</a> which is shady.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://fulltimehomebusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/profitgenesisreloadedscamorlegit.png" alt="profit genesis reloaded 2.0 the owner is fake using fake scuba diving stock imagery"/></figure></div>



<h4>Testimonials</h4>



<p>Once you do your research , you will find out that the testimonials are actually paid actors who will fake it out for you as long as you write the script . It is safe to say that this is a site you should stay as far away from as possible. Everything about this seems wrong and off . The in-authenticity of it just irks me .  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-333" srcset="https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5.png 728w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5-300x122.png 300w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5-50x20.png 50w, https://scamverify.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5-370x150.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></figure>



<h4>Reboot</h4>



<p>What I mean when I say this is that this program has been done already but just with a different name. The owner is back for more blood in a sense as if they weren&#8217;t satisfied with the amount of people they scammed before . If you&#8217;re reading this make sure you was stay clear of scams like this. Do your research before jumping into anything it&#8217;s very important . You don&#8217;t want to lose money thinking you&#8217;re going to make it.</p>



<h2>Profit Genesis Conclusion </h2>



<p>In conclusion , If you came this far you pretty much know that this is a big SCAM. I want to inform you guys to stay clear because I do have your best interest at hand and this will only lose you money which no one likes to do . </p>
